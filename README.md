## 💡 Overview

**DRF React TODO App** is a simple productivity project designed to practice building **a full-stack application** with a modern tech stack — React on the frontend and Django REST Framework on the backend.

The goal was to strengthen my understanding of:
- REST API design and serialization
- React frontend integration using Axios
- PostgreSQL database configuration and data management

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🗒️ Create, read, update, and delete tasks  
- 🏷️ (Planned) Tag system for organizing tasks  
- ⚡ REST API built with Django REST Framework  
- 💬 Frontend communication via Axios  
- 🧱 PostgreSQL as the main database

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| **Backend** | Django REST Framework |
| **Frontend** | React (JavaScript, Axios) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL |
| **Language** | Python, JavaScript |

## 🧠 Project Motivation

This project was part of my journey to practice **building full-stack applications** — connecting a Django REST API to a modern frontend with React.  
It’s intentionally simple, focusing on architecture and integration rather than design or extra features.

Even though the project was **left unfinished**, it reflects:
- My familiarity with **DRF serialization, views, and models**
- Understanding of **React’s component-based structure**
- Experience working with **Axios requests and state updates**

## 🧩 Possible Future Additions

- 🕓 Authentication and user-based task management  
- 🕓 Tags and categories for tasks  
- 🕓 Docker setup for quick deployment  
- 🕓 UI improvements (Tailwind or Material UI)
